# Letter Of Recommendation

Welcome to the **Letter of Recommendation** decentralized application (DApp), designed to make the process of managing student recommendation requests more transparent, secure, and efficient using blockchain technology.

This smart contract allows students to submit their recommendation requests and provides authorized personnel with the ability to approve them â€” all while ensuring the integrity of the data through the power of the Ethereum blockchain.
